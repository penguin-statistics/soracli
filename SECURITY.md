## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability in our website, please send an email to the webmaster Alviss Reimu (`alvissreimu at gmail`), and we would like to kindly ask you to not disclose about the detail of the vulnerability to the public before we have released a fix. Thanks for making Penguin Statistics a better site ;)
